  Useless first post, a bit of meta discussion about the blogging 
  platform choice.
  
New Year, New Blog and New Blogging Platform
============================================

I've been fantasizing about starting a new blog for quite a while. I've been 
fantasizing in the same way as one fantasizes about getting fit, or about pear 
ice-cream. I finally decided to do it, mostly to better myself. I hope this 
will go better than my yearly promise to start jogging. Or my yearly promise 
not to re-watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It's also meant as a way to 
practice writing. I'm currently trying to type things as the words come into 
my head, but to be honest it's a bit hard. Writing has always been hard for 
me. I don't know why. I wish I could better myself in that regard, but it 
seems like the odds are stacked against me. Very much in the same way odds 
are stacked against Buffy at the end of 5th season. But Buffy survives, by 
being resurrected. She was in Heaven and now she's been pulled back on to Earth 
for seasons 6 and 7. It's pretty much the same thing, I was in Heaven re-watching 
Buffy, now I've been pulled back onto earth to write more blog 
posts. So in that way this is like a resurrection. Which is fitting since I 
have the habit of dressing up as Jesus. Also fitting since I'm trying to 
resurrect my blogging. I hope I'll be able to do that. Also jogging. And avoid 
re-watching Buffy. Oh Buffy how I miss you. 



Technical side of things
------------------------

I'm got bored of updating and worrying about WordPress. It seemed like a bit
too cumbersome solution for something quite as trivial as a blog. Also I'm a
big fan of having just a bunch of text files around and just editing them, 
instead of logging into WordPress and using their horrible multimedia editor.

I was considering of using Tumblr for this, uploading posts by a python 
script that would parse .txt files, but my solution didn't really satisfy me.
Also Tumblr seems to be a bit too lightweight for writing any kind of 
technical stuff and also having someone else host my content is a bit iffy.

Enter `rstblog <https://github.com/mitsuhiko/rstblog>`_ from `Armin Ronacher 
<http://lucumr.pocoo.org/>`_. It's exactly my kind of a thing, a python script
that generates static .html files from .rst files. Also big benefit for me was
using git as a version control system for my blog. We will see how all of this 
will go, but I have a good feeling about things. And Buffy DVD box has been 
hidden well.
