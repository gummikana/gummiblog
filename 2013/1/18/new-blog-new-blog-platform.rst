New Year, New Blog and New Blogging Platform
============================================

For a while I've been itching to start a new blog. I don't really know the reasons for it, but I guess it has something to do with feeling being stuck with `Kloonigames <http://kloonigames.com/blog/>` and `Crayon Physics <http:://www.crayonphysics.com/>`. Also lately I've been doing lot of interesting technical things and I wanted a place to brag... share them. Other reason was that I've been meaning to start archiving my talks that I've given in somewhere and this seemed to be good way to fix that issue.

Last straw that broke the camels back, was when I found out about `rstblog <https://github.com/mitsuhiko/rstblog>` from `Armin Ronacher <http://lucumr.pocoo.org/>`. I've been agonizing which blog platform to use. My experiences with WordPress haven't been all that positive, it's text editor is more annoying than handy. Tumblr seems to be a bit too lightweight for writing technical stuff. Also I don't like the fact that someone else hosts my data and content. Although not having to worry about updating software, fixing webservers is a big plus. 

Anyway rstblog seemed to be a nice solution. But time will tell what happens.

Here's the links I used to setup rstblog:
