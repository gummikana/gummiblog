About Me
========

Hi, my name is Petri Purho and I'm an independent game developer. I dabble
in game design, coding and in magic tricks. 

At the moment I'm living in Helsinki, although I travel a lot and my mom
sometimes worries about that. Which is why I created a php script to send
her emails telling her that I'm alive.

I also like `giving talks </talks>`_ at various conferences.
